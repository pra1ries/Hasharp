# To Do

## High Priority
- [ ] Make hashing run asynchronously so that you can still interact with the window during attempts.
- [ ] Find and eliminate user-induced runtime errors.
- [ ] Somehow increase the rate at which Hasharp attempts to crack a hash. (Multithreading?)
- [ ] Allow user to use more hashing algorithms. See [supported algorithms](supportedalgorithms).

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Default to GPU as opposed to running on the CPU.

## Low Priority
- [ ] UI v2
